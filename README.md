## Installation

### Step 1: Install line-bot-mcp-server

requirements:

- Node.js v20 or later

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:line/line-bot-mcp-server.git
```bash

Install the necessary dependencies and build line-bot-mcp-server when using Node.js. This step is not required when using Docker:

```bash

cd line-bot-mcp-server && npm install && npm run build

```bash

### Step 2: Get a channel access token

This MCP server utilizes a LINE Official Account. If you do not have one, please create it by following [this instructions](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/getting-started/#create-oa).

If you have a LINE Official Account, enable the Messaging API for your LINE Official Account by following [this instructions](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/getting-started/#using-oa-manager).

To connect to the Messaging API, you need to have a channel access token. You can confirm this by following [this instructions](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/basics/channel-access-token/#long-lived-channel-access-token).

Additionally, you will need the user ID of the recipient user for messages. You can confirm this by following [this instructions](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/getting-user-ids/#get-own-user-id).

### Step 3: Configure AI Agent

Please add the following configuration for an AI Agent like Claude Desktop or Cline.
Insert the channel access token and user ID you obtained earlier into `CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `DESTINATION_USER_ID`, respectively.
Additionally, update the path to `line-bot-mcp-server` in  `mcpServers.args`.

#### Option 1: Use Node

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "line-bot": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "PATH/TO/line-bot-mcp-server/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN" : "FILL_HERE",
        "DESTINATION_USER_ID" : "FILL_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```bash

#### Option 2: Use Docker

Build the Docker image first:

```bash

docker build -t line/line-bot-mcp-server .

```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "line-bot": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
        "-e",
        "DESTINATION_USER_ID",
        "line/line-bot-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN" : "FILL_HERE",
        "DESTINATION_USER_ID" : "FILL_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
